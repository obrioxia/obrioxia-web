        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          All data in transit is protected with TLS 1.3. Data at rest is protected using per-event
          envelope encryption: AES-256-GCM with a unique Data Encryption Key (DEK) per record,
          wrapped with RSA-OAEP using the writer's public key. The production service holds only the
          public key — it can seal records but never decrypt historical data.

        <h3 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">Tamper-Evident Cryptographic Chaining</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Every decision event is cryptographically chained to its predecessor using SHA-256 hashing. Any modification —
          even a single character — breaks the chain and is immediately detectable. The chain is linear, rooted at a
          genesis block, with uniqueness enforced via indexed constraints on each link.

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          We resolve the conflict between "Tamper-Evident Logs" and "Right to be Forgotten." By encrypting PII with
          write-only per-event keys before hashing, we allow for the cryptographic destruction of personal data. When a
          record's key material is destroyed, PII access is permanently revoked and the data is rendered
          cryptographically irrecoverable, while the audit trail remains intact and verifiable.

          Obrioxia manages data retention through cryptographic access revocation to align with your legal jurisdiction.

        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Obrioxia reconciles immutable audit logs with data-erasure obligations through cryptographic key destruction.
          When a subject exercises their Right to Erasure, the per-event DEK wrapped on the record
          is permanently nulled. The encrypted data remains in the ledger but becomes cryptographically irrecoverable.
          Chain verification continues to pass because the hash computation explicitly excludes key material.

        <h3 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">Retention Enforcement</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Retention periods are enforced cryptographically according to the active subscription plan.
          When a record exceeds its retention window, the wrapped encryption key associated with that record is
          permanently destroyed. Encrypted data remains part of the tamper-evident chain, but becomes mathematically
          irrecoverable. Retention is enforced at the evidence layer, not merely defined in policy.
