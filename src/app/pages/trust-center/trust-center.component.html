        Obrioxia is built on a "Zero Trust" philosophy. We assume that systems can be compromised, and we design our ledger to provide forensic evidence even in adversarial conditions.

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          We utilize industry-standard TLS 1.3 for all data in transit. Data at rest is protected using envelope encryption. Our v3.9 Crypto-Shredding engine uses robust, per-subject key management to ensure granular control over data visibility.

        <h3 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-3">The Immutable Model</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          Our core security thesis is "Write Once, Read Many" (WORM). Once a decision ID is generated and hashed into the chain, it cannot be altered by Obrioxia staff, your admins, or external attackers without breaking the verification protocols.

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          We resolve the conflict between "Immutable Logs" and "Right to be Forgotten." By encrypting PII prior to hashing, and managing keys separately from the ledger, we allow for the cryptographic destruction of personal data. When a key is shredded, the data becomes unrecoverable noise, while the audit trail remains mathematically valid.

          Obrioxia allows for configurable data retention policies to map to your legal jurisdiction. Audit logs can be configured for long-term archival (up to 7 years) to meet financial or healthcare regulations.

        <h3 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-3">Access Control Philosophy</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          We operate on a "Zero Standing Access" model. No engineer has permanent access to production decryption keys. Administrative actions, including key shredding, require just-in-time (JIT) authorization and are themselves logged to the immutable ledger.
