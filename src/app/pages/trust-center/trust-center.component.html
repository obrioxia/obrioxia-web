        Obrioxia is built on a "Zero Trust" philosophy. We assume that systems can be compromised, and we design our

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          We utilise TLS 1.3 for all data in transit. Data at rest is protected using envelope
          encryption with industry-standard authenticated ciphers. Our write-only crypto-shredding engine uses per-event
          sealing to ensure the production service can encrypt data but never decrypt historical records.

        <h3 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-3">The Tamper-Evident Model</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          Our core security thesis is "Write Once, Read Many" (WORM). Once a decision ID is generated and secured via
          cryptographic hash-chaining, any alteration — by internal staff, your admins, or external attackers — breaks
          the
          chain and is detected by the Chain Verifier.

        <h3 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-3">Privacy & Right to Erasure</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          We resolve the conflict between "Tamper-Evident Logs" and "Right to be Forgotten." By encrypting PII with
          write-only per-event keys before hashing, we allow for the cryptographic destruction of personal data. When a
          record's key material is destroyed, PII access is permanently revoked and the data is rendered
          cryptographically irrecoverable, while the audit trail remains intact and verifiable.

          Obrioxia manages data retention through cryptographic access revocation to align with your legal jurisdiction.
          Retention periods vary by subscription tier. Contact us for details on long-term archival options.

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          Write-only protection for sensitive fields: the service cannot decrypt stored PII. Two authentication modes
          are supported: demo API keys for sandbox exploration, and Firebase Bearer tokens for production accounts.
          PDF generation and data access are ownership-verified — you can only retrieve records you created.
