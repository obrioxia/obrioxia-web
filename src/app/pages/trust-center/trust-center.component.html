        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          We utilise TLS 1.3 for all data in transit. Data at rest is protected using envelope
          encryption with industry-standard authenticated ciphers. When configured in write-only mode, our
          crypto-shredding engine uses per-event sealing to ensure the production service can encrypt data but never
          decrypt historical records.

        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Every decision event is cryptographically chained to its predecessor using SHA-256 hashing. Any modification —
          even a single character — breaks the chain and is immediately detectable. The chain is linear, rooted at a
          genesis
          block, and enforced by database-level unique constraints on each link.

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">
          We resolve the conflict between "Tamper-Evident Logs" and "Right to be Forgotten." By encrypting PII with
          write-only per-event keys before hashing, we allow for the cryptographic destruction of personal data. When a
          record's key material is destroyed, PII access is permanently revoked and the data is rendered
          cryptographically irrecoverable, while the audit trail remains intact and verifiable.

        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Obrioxia reconciles immutable audit logs with data-erasure obligations through cryptographic key destruction.
          When a subject exercises their Right to Erasure, the wrapped per-event encryption key is permanently deleted
          from the key store. The encrypted data remains in the ledger but becomes irrecoverable. Chain verification
          continues to pass because the hash chain does not depend on the encryption key material.
