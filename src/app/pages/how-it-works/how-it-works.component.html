        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          Think of Obrioxia as a "Black Box" flight recorder for your AI fleet. Just as an aircraft recorder survives a
          crash to tell investigators what happened, Obrioxia creates a tamper-evident record of your AI's
          decision-making process. It provides the "Digital Alibi" you need when liability is in question.

      <div class="glass-panel p-8 rounded-xl border border-white/10">
        <h2 class="text-2xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">Layer 2: The Mechanism</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">We do not use standard database logs which can be edited by admins. Instead, we
          use a cryptographic chain.</p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 ml-4">
          <li>Every event is converted into a strict, canonical format.</li>
          <li>We calculate a SHA-256 hash of that event combined with the hash of the previous event.</li>
          <li>This creates an unbroken chain. If anyone tries to delete or modify a record in the past, the mathematical
            link breaks, and the Verifier will flag the system as corrupted.</li>
        </ol>

      <div class="glass-panel p-8 rounded-xl border border-white/10">
        <h2 class="text-2xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">Layer 3: Enterprise Controls</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
          While the chain is tamper-evident, the data payload handles privacy intelligently. Sensitive fields are
          encrypted with write-only keys before they enter the ledger. This allows you to retain the *proof* of a
          decision for regulatory purposes while cryptographically shredding the *personal details* of the user on
          request, addressing two conflicting regulatory requirements.
