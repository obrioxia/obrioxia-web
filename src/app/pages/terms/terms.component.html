        <h2 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">3. User Obligations</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li>You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms.</li>
          <li>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your API keys and account credentials.</li>
          <li>You verify that any data submitted to the ledger does not violate third-party intellectual property rights
            or applicable laws.</li>
          <li>You acknowledge that while Obrioxia provides tools for GDPR compliance (Crypto-Shredding), you remain the

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">4. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The Service, including its architecture, hash-chaining algorithms, codebase, and visual design, is the
          exclusive property of Obrioxia. Our technology for privacy-aware tamper-evident logging is Patent pending. You
          are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to access
          and use the Service for your internal business operations during the term of your subscription.

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">5. Tamper-Evident Ledger & Data Integrity</h2>
        <p>
          Obrioxia utilizes a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) architecture. You acknowledge that once data is sealed into
          the hash chain, it cannot be edited, modified, or silently deleted by any party, including Obrioxia
          administrators. Data deletion is only possible through our specific Crypto-Shredding protocols, which render
          the payload unreadable while maintaining the cryptographic integrity of the chain.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>

          ASSIST WITH COMPLIANCE (EU AI ACT, GDPR, ISO 42001), OBRIOXIA DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL ADVICE, AND USE OF THE
          SERVICE DOES NOT GUARANTEE LEGAL COMPLIANCE.

          IN NO EVENT SHALL OBRIOXIA BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE
          DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR IN
