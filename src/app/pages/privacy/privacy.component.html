        <p>
          Obrioxia ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
          collect, use, and secure your personal information when you use our Enterprise AI Audit platform. By using the
          Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

        <h2 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">2. Data We Collect</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 ml-4">
          <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Name, work email, company name, and authentication credentials.</li>
          <li><strong>Audit Log Data:</strong> Data payloads sent to our API for logging. We separate technical metadata
            from Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using our proprietary encryption architecture.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Information on how the Service is accessed and used (e.g., IP address,
            browser type, timestamps).</li>

        <h2 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">3. The Tamper-Evident Ledger & GDPR</h2>
        <p>
          Obrioxia operates on a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) architecture. To reconcile the permanence of the
          hash-chained ledger with GDPR "Right to Erasure" requirements, we utilise a crypto-shredding technique. PII is
          encrypted with write-only per-event keys before hashing. If you request deletion, we destroy the specific key
          material, rendering your personal data cryptographically irrecoverable while leaving the audit integrity
          intact.

        <h2 class="text-xl text-white font-orbitron mb-4">6. Security</h2>
        <p>
          The security of your data is important to us. We use TLS 1.3 encryption for data in transit and advanced
          envelope encryption for data at rest. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of
          electronic storage is 100% secure.
